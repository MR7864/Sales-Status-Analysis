# **Sales Status Analysis**

## **Overview**

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of sales data using cutting-edge machine-learning techniques. The project utilizes Python, Jupyter Notebook, and PowerBI for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. The main focus is on classifying and visualizing sales data from Kaggle to provide accurate insights into sales performance.

## **Technologies Used**

**Python:** The core programming language used for data manipulation, feature engineering, and machine learning model implementation.
**Jupyter Notebook:** An interactive and collaborative environment for running Python code, facilitating step-by-step analysis and code sharing.
**PowerBI:** A powerful business analytics tool for creating interactive visualizations and reports, enhancing data-driven decision-making.
Machine Learning Algorithms

The project employs three prominent classification algorithms:

**Decision Tree Classifier:** A tree-like model that breaks down a dataset into smaller subsets, aiding in the classification of sales data.

**Random Forest Classifier:** An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve overall accuracy and robustness.

**Support Vector Machine (SVM):** A powerful algorithm for classification and regression tasks, particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces.

## **Data Source**

The sales data used in this project is sourced from Kaggle, a platform for predictive modelling and analytics competitions. The dataset is carefully selected to showcase the capabilities of the implemented machine learning models.

## **Key Features**

**Data Preprocessing:** Comprehensive data cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming features to prepare the dataset for machine learning.

**Classification:** Utilizing Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM algorithms to classify sales data into relevant categories.

**Visualization:** Leveraging PowerBI for creating visually appealing and informative dashboards that facilitate easy interpretation of sales trends and patterns.
